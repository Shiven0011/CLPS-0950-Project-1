README for Project 1 --> Some key notes for the teaching staff!

Hi CLPS 0950 teaching staff,

I just wanted to let you all know which files in the Repo are the most important for our final project submission!

1. "master.m" --> This file contains our master function code and code for all three of the ciphers!
2. "Video Links.pdf" --> This file contains two important video links for our final submission. One link is our team describing our code, our logic, and challenges.
The second link is a screen-recording (with audio) of our code in action!
3. "Project 1 Work Log (Sid, Shrey, Shiven)" --> This file is our complete work log from start to end!

I hope this looks good to you all and that you all enjoy our project. Thank you!

Best,
Shrey, Sid, Shiven
